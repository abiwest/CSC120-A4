- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I think that it's been pretty useful so far in this assignment! In this assignment, I almost entirely used public methods, so I still don't feel super confident in working with the two different types. I used the accessor method a few times in this assignment and I felt that it was pretty helpful.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignemnt actually ended up being a bit easier and more intuitive for me than the previous one. I think that this was because all of the seperation of the different classes made each one a bit more simple in their induvidual functions. I had a bit of trouble figuring out the integration of one class with another, but I was able to troubleshoot that by just taking a break and coming back to it. I was able to work on one class at a time, and take breaks inbetween which ended up being quite a helpful tool for me, because those checkpoints allowed my progress to be much more linear.
